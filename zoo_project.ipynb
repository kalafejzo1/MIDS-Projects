    "# Project 1: Zoo Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will code a simple simulation of a zoo, in which animals move around on a grid following a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning objectives:\n",
    "1. Understand how to design classes that interact to acheive a programming goal.\n",
    "2. Identify situations in which classes are an appropriate tool for organizing program components.\n",
    "3. Utilize a class hierarchy to organize code.\n",
    "4. Be able to debug a multi-class program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections detail the components you will need to create. We recommend you write your code in the following order, completing one component before moving on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LocalView\n",
    "\n",
    "This class represents the area around an animal that the animal is able to see. It stores the directions that the animal is able to move in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, an animal should always have the option of staying in the same spot, represented by the string 'stay'. Your code must replicate the following behavior exactly to pass the autograder.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Animal and Subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to create a hierarchy of classes to represent different animals. The class at the top of the hierarchy should be `Animal`, an abstract base class. That means that some methods in `Animal` will not be implemented (they may contain just a `pass` command or raise a `NotImplementedError`). These abstract methods are important, because they define the set of methods that all subclasses are expected to implement. You should make sure that all appropriate methods are defined in the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimum of 2 subclasses of `Animal` is required. Every animal should be represented by a one-character string attribute named `icon`. Each subclass of `Animal` that you create must replicate the following behavior exactly (replace `AnimalSubclass` with the name of your subclass).\n",

    "For every `Animal` subclass you create, you will need to decide how the animal moves. In every time step, the possible move options are contained in a `LocalView` instance. It is up to you to decide how each animal selects one of these options. Each subclass of `Animal` that you create must replicate the following behavior exactly (replace `AnimalSubclass` with the name of your subclass).\n",

    "## Zoo\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Zoo` class represents the enclosure in which animals move. It is organized as a rectangular grid, with size specified by a `height` attribute and a `width` attribute. A grid position is given by a row between `0` and `height-1`, and a column between `0` and `width-1`. Note that Python coordinates are generally ordered as (`row`, `column`) or (`height`, `width`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to design your zoo class so that it keeps track of the positions of all animals. There is more than one way to do this, so take your time to think about this step before you start coding. See if you can think of two different data structures that could store animal and position data and consider their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `Zoo` class must replicate the following behavior exactly (replace `AnimalSubclass` with the name of your subclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "zoo = Zoo(10,5)\n",
    "zoo.height\n",

    "zoo.animal_at_position(0,2) == animal\n",
    ">>> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Zoo` class also manages animal movement through the `time_step` method. Each `Animal` is allowed to move `north`, `east`, `south`, `west`, or `stay`, as long as they don't move out of the grid or move into a spot occupied by another `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `time_step` is called, it should give every animal in the zoo a chance to move. Animals should move one at a time. This means that the `Zoo` should call the first animal's `move` method, update the animal's position, then move on to the next animal. The following interactive session demonstrates the proper behavior (replace `AnimalSubclass` with the name of your subclass). Note that your animals may move in different positions.\n",
    "\n",

    "## ZooDisplay\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are often used to organize a program's user interface. For this project, your instructors are providing you with a class, `ZooDisplay`, which you will adapt to visualize your `Zoo` and periodically call `Zoo.time_step`. `ZooDisplay` uses Python's `tkinter` package, which is a popular package for user interface development. To keep things simple, `ZooDisplay` uses a `tkinter` `Text` widget, so you only have to decide what string to pass in. Better-looking visuals can be created using a `tkinter` `Canvas` widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "Interested students are invited to suggest an extension to this project. Your instructor may award a small number of bonus points for a completed extension (maximum 5 points). Extensions must be agreed upon ahead of time, and are expected to add at least 50% to the functionality of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit a Jupyter notebook using Gradescope. Below, you will find some starter code. You should place your class definitions into the cell with a grading tag at the top. The autograder will look for this tag and run the code in that cell only."
