    "## General Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In each code block, do NOT delete the ### comment at the top of a cell (it's needed for the auto-grading!)\n",
    "  - Autograder tests and results are on gradescope.\n",
    "  - You will get 80 points from the autograder for this assignment and 20 points will be hidden. That is, passing all of the visible tests will give you 80 points. Make sure you are meeting the requirements of the problem to get the other 20 points!\n",
    "  - You may upload and run the autograder as many times as needed in your time window\n",
    "  - The assignment needs to be named HW_Unit_04.ipynb to be graded from the autograder!\n",
    "  - The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your code outputs the same information.\n",
    "    - In addition to the given example, the autograder will test other examples\n",
    "    - Each autograder test tells you what input it is using\n",
    "  - Once complete, the autograder will show each tests, if that test is passed or failed, and your total score\n",
    "  - The autograder fails for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "    - Your code crashes with that input (for example: `Test Failed: string index out of range`)\n",
    "    - Your code output does not match the 'correct' output (for example: `Test Failed: '1 2 3 2 1' != '1 4 6 4 1'`)\n",
    "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer, you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",
    "- Adding comments in your code is strongly suggested but won't be graded.\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your code outputs the same information.\n",
    "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class Google group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private email to all of the instructors at: mids-python-instructors@googlegroups.com\n",
    "- You may use any libraries from the Python Standard Library for this assignment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/\n",
    "- We also have a tutor if you would like a 1 on 1 session!"
